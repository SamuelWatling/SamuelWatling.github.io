[The Corn Laws and Modern Planning](https://housingcrisis.substack.com/p/the-planning-system-is-todays-corn) 
is a short piece on what classical economists, primarily David Ricardo, meant when they were talking about rent in the 19th century
and how these 19th century essays on (mainly) farming should interpreted in a modern setting.
