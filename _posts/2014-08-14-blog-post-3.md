[Britain's Forgotten Financial Crisis](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/britains-forgotten-financial-crisis) is the publicised version of
my undergraduate dissertation. It tells the previously forgotten story of the period of Britains most significant 
real house price inflation in the early 1970s. However unlike previous accounts it goes further by arguing that 
there was no house price bubble during this period. Instead the "boom" was a price correction after a period of 
brutal financial repression which had coincided with aggressive tax cuts for housing coupled with tight planning restrictions.
