Welcome! I am a Political Scientist and Formal Theorist currently working in a predoctoral research assistant at Trinity College Dublin.
My research is in the field of urban politics with a particular focus on the political impacts of housing tenure
and the impact and political determinants of planning restrictions. To do this I employ both formal theory and causal inference methods with 
historical datasets. My recent work includes [The Housebuilding Crisis](https://www.centreforcities.org/publication/the-housebuilding-crisis/) and
[Why Britain Doesnt Build](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-britain-doesnt-build/). You can find my published work, data and code on [European Housing](https://samuelwatling.github.io/European/) and information on
my [current research project.](https://samuelwatling.github.io/current-research/). 

Please find my CV [here.](https://samuelwatling.github.io/cv/)
