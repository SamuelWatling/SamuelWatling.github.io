Welcome! I am a Political Scientist and Formal Theorist currently working in a predoctoral research assistant at Trinity College Dublin.
My research is in the field of urban politics with a particular focus on the political impacts of housing tenure
and the impact and political determinants of planning restrictions. To do this I employ both formal theory and causal inference methods with 
historical datasets. You can find my published work, data and code on [European Housing](https://samuelwatling.github.io/European/) and the draft of 
my [current research project](https://samuelwatling.github.io/working-papers/). 

Please find my CV [here](https://samuelwatling.github.io/cv/)
