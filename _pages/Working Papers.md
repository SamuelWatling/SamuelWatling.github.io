My Current work centers around a new dataset created using OCR to process the British housing returns from 1947 to 2000. 
These were quarterly statistics published by the British government detailing housebuilding by district in England and Wales. 
This enables the quarterly reconstruction by tenure of the housing stock in each district from 1947 to 2000.
